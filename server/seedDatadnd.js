      title: 'Currency in Durenbrost',
      content: `Durenbrõst's currency consists of gold auri, silver elo, and copper rängõn. 

Ten rängõnet are equivalent to one elo, and ten elot to an auri. 

Auri (Gold Pieces)
The Auri's current design was determined at the beginning of the Third Age - a bright and hopeful post-war time. Its face features the broad-rayed visage of the rising sun, and its rear the shape of a post-Exodia Durenbrõst. 

Auri are made from pure gold, which allows them to hold well their value; from this, the whole currency derives its worth. 

Elo (Silver Pieces)
The Elo was the highest denomination of coin in Durenbrõst in the first age, at which point it was made from platinum and equal in value to ten myyri (which historians believe was a first-age equivalent to auri). Those who traded elo were, at the time, numbering among Gods and kings.

Nowadays, elo are not valuable; rather, they are worth a tenth of a gold piece (auri). Their value is stable relative to the value of gold - which, in turn, means that it need not have value of its own; instead, the coins are made from a substance known as fool's silver, which is hard and - as the name implies - silver.

The front of the elo features a strange shape of unknown origin, which people speculate to be a pond. As of the last twenty years, the elo's rear features the country's coat of arms.

The fool's silver from which elot are made is sourced from mines in The Rocksplit Coast.

Rängõn (Copper Pieces)
The Rängõn is the lowliest of coins, and made of near-worthless copper - a metal hardly worth the effort of extracting it from the ground. Rängõnet are believed to have evolved from the earliest currencies in Sadé, which were traded by small communities in a time before the First Age. Of course, the existence of time before the First Age is hotly debated.

Rängõnet are made from copper, which is easily available. These coins are typically undecorated, and counterfeits are more common than minted coins.`,
